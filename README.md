# Welcome

GolangIndia is an initiative by members of the Go<sup>TM</sup> community in India to:

1. Help spread awareness of Golang
2. Encourage the community to share their work with a wider audience
3. Improve collaboration within and between members of various towns and cities in India
4. Encourage community driven study groups and meetups

The initiatives are India-centered to help members within local geographies meet face-to-face at city meetups, and also join online sessions conducted at favourable [IST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Standard_Time). However, people from all over the world are welcome to collaborate and participate.

## What Next?

This initiative is work-in-progress at this point.
Please check back soon.
